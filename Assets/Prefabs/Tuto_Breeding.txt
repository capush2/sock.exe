Seeing as socks don't have a gender, the sock on the left will be considered the male in this exercise while the one on the right will be the female. For reference, a sock has three colors on its body: the primary color is the color of its whole body; the secondary color is the color of the bottom of the sock; the third color is the color of the ring on the sock's midsection.
Your choice affects the outcome's probabilities seeing as the male is more likely to pass on his main color to his offspring, while the female is more likely to pass on her secondary color. The third color has an equal chance of coming from either parent. Choose wisely to get the desired result.
